## Key-Value store

This is completed project for a very simple key value database in C, I would love to do some additional work on it like actual hashing and resizing of the array.

To make it a more elaborate project I would want to use the ideas from the links below:
[Implementing Hash Tables](https://www.andreinc.net/2021/10/02/implementing-hash-tables-in-c-part-1#division-hashing)
[Crafting Interpreters: Hash Tables](https://craftinginterpreters.com/hash-tables.html)
